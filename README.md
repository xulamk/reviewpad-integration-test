# Reviewpad Integration Test

Integration tests are tests that are performed on a complete system to ensure that the components of the system work together as expected. They are typically used to test the communication between components in a system, such as an API and its supporting services, as well as to test the system as a whole. Unit tests, on the other hand, are used to test the basic features of a single component, such as a single function or class. Unit tests are typically used to ensure that individual components are working as expected, while integration tests are used to ensure that the system as a whole is working properly.
