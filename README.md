# Reviewpad Integration Test

Integration tests are conducted on a full system to check that its components interact as expected. They are usually used to test the communication between components, such as an API and its related services, as well as to verify the system's overall functioning. Unit tests, on the other hand, are used to test the basic features of an individual component, such as a single function or class. Unit tests are typically used to make sure that individual components are working correctly, while integration tests are used to ensure that the system is functioning properly as a whole.
